# ELFMOPE-Analyzer
A binary static analysis tool written in C.
The tool will support ELF, Mach-O, and PE image formats.
I am writing this tool for myself, as I learn the principles of reverse engineering and static analysis. This is just for my own educational purposes, but I hope others find it useful as well.

I will go in to more detail about the functionality and how to use ELFMOPE once the development is further along.
